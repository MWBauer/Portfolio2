   <h2 class="yellow-text" id="Experience">Experience:</h2>
     <p>Ever since the late 1980's my father and I have been tinkering with computers. I have played many games and I use MS Office fluently. I have dabbled in Linux and GeoWorks, while using Windows and DOS extensively. Currently I'm learning on FreeCodeCamp.com how to write programs for varying reasons and in varying ways.
  <br/><br/>
  I have carried many jobs in fast food, food service, computer repair and retail. You can imagine the inherent duties. I have also worked in a few hospitals during my Associates degree rotation learning how to work the many different positions in a medical records department. I have worked hard to learn interpersonal communication, both in person and on the phone. Also, I have learned how to handle money and protected personal information.
<br/><br/>
  Coding has become a passion of mine. I love the many different languages and learning how they work. I look forward to learning as many of them as I can and utilizing them to benefit an employer as well as the customer while I grow in my knowledge and understanding. I love a good challenge! I have briefly studied the following spoken languages:
  <ul>
   <li>French</li>
   <li>German</li>
   <li>Hindi</li>
   <li>Spanish</li>
  </ul>
     </p>
<h2 id="Hobbies">Hobbies:</h2>
<p> I have always loved computers. I was an avid gamer for years and years but I have found myself more interested in the process than in the playing. And so, I've been learning how to code. There's no telling where that will take me. Some of the languages that I have dabbled in are:
 
 <ul>
   <li> HTML (as basic to know as MS Word)</li>
   <li> C++</li>
   <li> Javascript</li>
   <li> CSS</li>
   <li> Vagrant</li>
   <li>WordPress</li>
 </ul>

 I enjoy running, biking, hiking, and working out. I don't want to be a major muscle head, but I would like to get into and stay in decent physical condition. I enjoy playing some sports like disc golf and volleyball. I also really enjoy adventuring into new foods and drinks. This world is full of enjoyment, we just have to find it and partake. Playing cards or just sitting around talking is also fun for me. </p>
